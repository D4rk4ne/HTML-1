<h1>About Me</h1> 
  
    Hello! <br/>
    <p>
    My name is William, and I'm passionate about coding. I enjoy creating things that are both functional and meaningful, and I’m always eager to learn and explore new ideas. Whether I'm working on a personal project or collaborating with others, I give my full attention to detail and creativity.

    I started my journey in web development and tech out of curiosity, and it quickly grew into something more. Over time, I’ve built skills in HTML and making further progress with CSS, JavaScript, Adobe XD, and I love turning ideas into real experiences people can enjoy and interact with.

    Outside of work, I enjoy skating, gaming, exploring nature. I believe that balance and inspiration go hand in hand, and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges that push me to grow. Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to learn more about me!
